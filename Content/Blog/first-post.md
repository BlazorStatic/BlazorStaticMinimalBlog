# Creating with Heart: A Playful Guide to Ethical Design üíñ

## 1. Introduction

Photo filters which alter users' faces and contribute to a negative impact on mental health and a decline in confidence levels among users. What do these examples have in common? *They were designed by designers.*

Imagine a world where every product you use, from your favorite app's photo filters to your morning coffee maker, is designed with your well-being at its core. What if each design decision was made not just for profit, but for the greater good of society and the environment? This is the promise of *ethical design*‚Äîa philosophy that insists on humanity and responsibility in the creative process.

No, you don't have to be a designer to practice ethical design. The framework can be applied across any process that involves creating something for an end user. Afterall, everyone could use a reminder to sprinkle a little more human-centered ethics into their decision-making. ‚ú®

## 2. What is Ethical Design Anyway?

Ethical design should aim to make products that are good for *users*, *business*, and for *society*‚Äîall while keeping the human at the center of all decision-making.
In the end, the resulting product should help the user accomplish what they want, meet their individual needs, be easy and pleasant to use, with little to no effects on them and their environment. It's more important than ever to take time to consider the ethical consequences behind decisions.

## 3. Principles of Ethical Design
Explain guiding principles of Ethical Design. Talk about principles such as Privacy, Transparency & Persuasion, User Involvement, Focus, and Sustainability.
The "Ethical Hierachy of Needs" created by Aral Balkan and Laura Kalbag is inspired by the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. It illustrates how each element depends closely on each layer to make sure ethical design is met.

## 4. Making Your Creative Process More Ethical
Introduce ways to adopt ethical design practices into your daily workflow. Examples of companies or projects that exemplify ethical design.

How can I ensure that ethical design principles are considered in my workflow? One way to approach this is by starting from the very beginning and redefining your design process. Kat Zhou has redesigned and proposed a new way to approach the design thinking process in a more holistic way. Starting with the classic [Standford d.School's Design Thinking Process](https://dschool-old.stanford.edu/sandbox/groups/designresources/wiki/36873/attachments/74b3d/ModeGuideBOOTCAMP2010L.pdf) as her base, Zhou introduces a few new steps into her model.
Standford's Design Thinking Process has these steps:

Zhou adds in four new steps below (Evaluate, Forecast, Ship, and Monitor) to factor in more ethical thinking in the design process as part of her  < Design Ethically > framework:

Here is a brief explanation of the new steps:
- **Evaluate:** This step includes looking at the problem statement at hand and closely analyzing if it passes the test of ethics. An example is finding out early on that your product's new feature may by wrongfully stealing user data and breaching their data privacy. If you can already figure this out early on in your process, it may be worth revaluating if this new feature is worth it to continue to pursure.
- **Forecast:** Look into the magical crystal ball of the future! You will want to gather all the ideas that your team has brainstormed and try to see if there are any ethical weak spots or areas for potential exploitation.
- **Ship:** After extensive user testing and thorough forecasting of any potential ethical challenges, time to ship that product out into the real world! Yay!
- **Monitor:** Keep a continuous feedback loop open after you ship that product to see if there are any ethical problems that your team can address right away.

## 5. Ethical Challenges in an Evolving World
Every day, designers face many ethical challenges in their work. An extreme example can be seen in the creation of harmful products, such as weapons, exclusionary structures like hostile architecture, and tools like photo filters that impact mental health. All of these examples have one common thread - they prioritize aesthetics and profit over human well-being. The societal consequences‚Äîranging from increased violence and homicide, widening social inequality to severely diminished self-esteem‚Äîshow the crucial need for designers to slow down and really consider the long-term effects of their work and to strive for more ethical compassion in what they put out into the world.

## 6. Using Play to Guide Your Ethical Spirit
How can we use the value of 'play' to become more ethical? While ethics may sometimes have a reputation for being the strict rule enforcer, who says ethics can't also be fun?
Embracing the world of play can be a really powerful way to inspire creativity. We can set sail into new perspectives, challenge preconceived assumptions, and find joy simply in the process of creating more ethically woven products.
Here are a few suggestions on how incorporate play into your own design process:
1. **Gamify Feedback:** Create fun, engaging ways for users to provide feedback on your design. Can they win something? Can you encourage them to quite literally play in a sandbox?
2. **Brainstorming Games:** Can you incorporate playful techniques during brainstorming sessions to generate ethical solutions? Think of a fun game or ways to engage with users.

## 7. The Future of Ethical Design
Ethical design isn‚Äôt just a set of rules‚Äîit‚Äôs a mindset, a commitment to creating with care and consideration to the end user and to the world. By embracing these principles while incorporating a playful spirit, we can design for a world that‚Äôs not only more innovative but also more just and sustainable. Let‚Äôs make ethical design the heart of our creative journey by building a culture that places the human at the forefront of all that we do! üß†‚ù§Ô∏è
